### Hi there 👋, I'm Oliver

I'm a Multimediadesigner & webdev. Which means i love doing frontend, design and UX, but i also know how to use a terminal and can manage my way around a DB.

If i have any downtime, im probably automating away the boring parts of my workflow

In my spare time I make 3D renders and models in Blender.

My current obsession is making my own social party game inspired by taskmaster

- 🔎 I’ve found a frontend job: I'm now maintaining a design system! 
- 🧙‍♂️ I’m playing around in blender when i have the time. The current goal is to become a blender wiz
