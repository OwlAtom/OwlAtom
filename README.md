### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Oliver

I'm a Multimediadesigner & webdev. Which means i love doing frontend, design and UX, but i also know how to use a terminal and can manage my way around a DB.
If i have any downtime, im probably automating away the boring parts of my workflow
In my spare time I make 3D renders and models in Blender.
My current obsession is making my own social party game inspired by taskmaster

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently looking for a frontend job. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning about AI and llms (local vs cloud) for a personal project.
